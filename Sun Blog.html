    <p>Do you know that the Sun is very important in our life? Sun is important in our life because it
    <br>
    <br>
    produces light, heat, energy and everything. We need light because
    <br>
    </br>
    if there is no light then we will not see anything at day. We need heat because if there is no heat then not only Earth
    <br>
    </br>
    also other planets will be cold. We also need energy because if there is no energy
    <br>
    </br>
    then we will not be strong. And it is very risky for us. The Sun is the star at the center of our Solar System. It is a perfect sphere
    <br>
    <br>
    hot plasma. It is too big.  It is 1 400 000 km long. We need 1.3 million Earths to fill the Sun.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sun is 100 times as wide as Earth, and 93 million miles far away
    <br>
    <br>
    Earth. Sun is also called Sol. The Sun was formed 4.5 billion years ago. And the Sun is 4.603 billion years old. It is the
    <br>
    <br>
    heavenly body in our Solar System. Visit solarsystem.nasa.gov to learn more Sun.

    <br>
    Thank You!</p>
